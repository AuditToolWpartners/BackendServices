TODO:

    - Fix a weird bug that causes the Local Storage to wipe after a refresh then clicking save.
        - Found reason, the Local Storage is grabbing the data from the OnChange function, this is bad as it will only update
        when the user types something new in. Will have to find a new way of grabbing these values.
            - Fixed simply by using the useEffect method.
                - New issue, when you have no data filled into the slots after a save and a refresh it fills the text with null.
                    - Doesn't happen on safari and only tested with firefox.
                        - Simply fixed using my new handleNull function.
                            - New issue, handleNull seems to be wiping out itModels, not entirely sure if it's because of handleNull
                            But something is causing it to be wiped after refresh on second save.
                                - Found the issue, forgot to se the useEffect.

    - Turn the first OrganisationDetails into a hook instead of writing the code directly to the page, this could reduce
    the amount of code required inside OrganisationDetails.js.

    - Work on a sort of "Next Page" button, it will simply just show the next amount of questions but hopefully wont need
    to actually make a whole new page for it.
        - Can use a React Stepper from MUI

    - Try and figure out how to implement the Google Sheets calculation into the site, I have a few ideas but no concrete plan
    yet. For example, I could use a file named calculation.js and write code in there and call it at the end to show results
    however this is not a good plan in the long run and would most likely need recoding. I could also make use of learning NodeJS
    backend but this may take quite a bit extra time, however will come with the benefit of being able to make accounts, dashboards etc.

Possible Ideas:

    -   If the bug above cannot be solved it may be a better idea to use an auto save function rather than trying to work with
    a button, I could possibly use a node package called "Timer" and could possible implement it like this?


        timer.start

        if(timer.time(‘%s’) == 10 {
	        save()
	        timer.clear
	        timer.start
        }



        return(
	        <div>{timer.time(‘%s’)</div>
        )
